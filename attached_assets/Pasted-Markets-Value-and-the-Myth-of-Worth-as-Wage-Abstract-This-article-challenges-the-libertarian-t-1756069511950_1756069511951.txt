Markets, Value, and the Myth of Worth-as-Wage

Abstract
This article challenges the libertarian thesis that one’s economic worth is fully captured by the wage or price the market offers. 
Drawing on lived experience and market dynamics, it is shown that identical services can be valued at vastly different rates 
depending not on intrinsic merit but on credibility, capital access, and structural asymmetries. The libertarian claim that 
“the market pays you what you are worth” is therefore false, and its acceptance erases the very possibility of exploitation. 
A constructive alternative is proposed: through carefully targeted interventions that lower barriers to entry and equalize visibility, 
markets could be restructured to make the worth–wage equation aspirationally true rather than dogmatically false.

I. Statement of Position

It is often claimed that one’s worth in the marketplace is identical to what one is paid. This claim is false, both conceptually and empirically. The same service, rendered by the same person, can command radically different prices depending on stage of career, access to capital, or ability to market oneself. I myself once performed for twenty dollars what I now perform for two thousand. Nothing intrinsic changed in the service; what changed was credibility, reputation, and position within the market. This demonstrates that market price is not identical with value.

II. Statement of Libertarian Dogma

The libertarian axiom in question holds that “you cannot meaningfully say you are worth more than X if the market only pays you X.” The principle is presented as a tautology: markets measure value, so whatever the market pays is the measure of value. If this were true, the very concept of exploitation would collapse: if you receive less than another, then by definition you are not exploited—you simply receive your “true” market value.

III. Affirmative Defense of Position

Empirical reality rebuts this. Consider the case of a small producer with a superior product but no capital for marketing. Consumers will pay a fraction of what they pay for a worse product sold by a large incumbent, because credibility, visibility, and brand presence carry more weight than quality alone. The market does not record worth; it records position. One’s ability to bootstrap from underpaid to adequately paid depends on capital reserves large enough to compete with firms that spend astronomical sums to advertise mediocrity. Absent such capital, a small entrant is structurally underpaid relative to the value of their contribution.

IV. Negative Defense: Refutation of the Dogma

The libertarian principle is not only false but toxic. It erases the possibility of exploitation, however obvious exploitation may be. If Joe offers the same service as Bob but is paid one-tenth as much because he lacks capital, networks, or is disadvantaged by prejudice, Joe is being exploited. Denying this fact by appeal to “the market” is sleight-of-hand: it confuses the contingent outcomes of bargaining asymmetries with the essence of value. In doing so, it protects entrenched powers and forecloses meaningful reform.

V. Intellectual Forbears (Without Overstatement)

The critique of “worth equals wage” has antecedents. Marx argued that workers systematically generate more value than they are paid, the surplus accruing to capital. Institutional economists such as Veblen and Commons noted that markets are not neutral equilibria but arenas shaped by power and institutions. Contemporary economists like Stiglitz and Ha-Joon Chang emphasize the effects of information asymmetry, capital lock-in, and structural inequality. While my purpose is not to revive communism, the alignment is instructive: others have noted that wages are not identical with worth.

VI. Toward a Market Worth-Truthful to Value

The task, then, is not to abandon markets but to make them more faithful to the value they purport to measure. The principle that “the market pays you what you are worth” could be made true, but only if markets are invigorated and disciplined by targeted government interventions: policies that lower entry costs, equalize marketing access, and correct structural asymmetries. In such an economy, the current libertarian dogma—so false when stated as description—could become true as aspiration. Markets would then cease to mask exploitation and would instead fulfill their alleged role of rewarding true worth.
