Fiction, Translation, and the Perceptualization of Judgment
Abstract

This article argues that literary analysis operates through a two-step process: first, it translates fictional content into non-fictional propositions; second, it explains why the reverse operation — the translation of concept back into image, event, or metaphor — delivers a distinctive cognitive and emotional force that discursive paraphrase cannot. Using Kafka’s The Metamorphosis as a point of departure, I develop a three-stage model of representation that clarifies why fictionalization is so powerful. In Stage 1, perception is raw and unframed; in Stage 2, perception is overlaid with conceptual judgment; in Stage 3, achieved through art, perception and judgment fuse, producing “perceptualized judgment.” I generalize this principle beyond literature, arguing that all art forms operate by collapsing the gap between what is perceived and what is conceptually apprehended. Fiction, music, and visual art are not mere representations of thought but sites where thought itself becomes perceptual.

1. Literary Analysis as Translation

Literary analysis often proceeds by converting narrative into non-fictional commentary. A story is translated into a conceptual claim about the world. Consider Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. On the surface, Gregor Samsa awakens as an insect. Analysis renders this as: Gregor was already insect-like in his life as a bureaucrat; the transformation literalizes his condition.

The act of analysis thus involves two moves: first, the extraction of a conceptual statement from a fictional narrative; second, the justification of why the fictional dramatization matters — why Kafka did not simply write an essay on bureaucratic dehumanization.

2. The Three-Stage Model of Representation

To explain why fictionalization matters, I propose a three-stage model.

Stage 1: Raw Perception. One observes empirical detail: the bureaucrat tying his tie, boarding the train, slouching at his desk. These are unframed data.

Stage 2: Conceptual Judgment. One overlays interpretation: “he is a bureaucrat,” “he is a broken man,” “he is like a cockroach.” Perception is overlaid with a discursive frame.

Stage 3: Perceptualized Judgment (Art). Fiction collapses judgment into perception. You no longer merely see Gregor at his desk and then judge him “cockroach-like”; you see him as a cockroach. The metaphor becomes literalized perception. What would otherwise be pale abstraction becomes lived immediacy.

The power of art, then, lies in its ability to fuse perception and judgment into a single act.

3. Generalizing Beyond Literature

This fusion is not unique to narrative fiction. It extends across the arts.

Music. A baboon can hear Mozart as sound; only a listener engaged in perceptualized cognition hears it as form, tension, and resolution.

Painting. An eagle may see paint more sharply than a human, but humans perceive figures and meaning in pigment.

Poetry. Words are not mere marks; they are felt as rhythm, tone, image, thought at once.

In each case, art transfigures raw perceptual data by embedding conceptual and affective work directly within perception.

Conclusion

Art matters because it does not merely tell us what to think; it allows us to see thought itself. Fictionalization is not the sugar-coating of concept but its transformation into percept. The critic’s task is to articulate this double movement: to translate fiction into non-fiction, and to show why the translation back into fiction yields a surplus of meaning and force.
