7) The tie-shop revisited: Even the best example is a sketch
Even taking the tie-shop as Sellars’ “worked” example, its instructive content is exactly what Berkeley had already made precise and general: perception’s deliverances are made determinate only via learned correspondences and multimodal integration
FOUNDATIONALISM AND BERKELEY
. Once that generalization is supplied, Sellars’ own role reduces to pointing—not building.
Interim verdict (Part II): Inferentialism and its functionalist extensions fail to secure meaning, mentality, or theoretical reference. They either presuppose the very items they aim to analyze or dilute them into pattern-talk that cannot carry explanatory load.

Part III — Replace Slogans with Systems: Epistemic Engines as the Alternative
8) Method shift: From discourse to execution
If Sellars’ legacy is a vocabulary without a methodology, the corrective is to operationalize philosophical theses as epistemic engines—systems that:
1.	ingest inputs (claims, texts, data),
2.	apply explicit norms (inference, defeaters, semantics, causal models),
3.	output decisions with audit trails, and
4.	admit refutation by performance (benchmarks, ablations, stress tests).
This is not speculative. Multiple such engines are already live (intelligence evaluation, originality analysis, dialogic synthesis, course-grade adjudication), and the present article itself was produced through a cyborgenetic pipeline—human originality fused with machine scalability—consistent with the anti-foundationalist mechanisms Berkeley actually described

.
9) How engines adjudicate what discourse cannot
•	Reasons vs. causes becomes a testable interface: models succeed or fail at predicting and explaining purposive action when reasons are encoded as causal constraints (or not).
•	Manifest vs. scientific image becomes case resolution: modules propose reconciliations, and benchmarks score which reconciliation predicts perceptual/cognitive outcomes on held-out tasks.
•	Against inferentialism: CRS-only engines should, and do, fail on novelty, error-correction, and compositional probes; engines with semantic anchors succeed.
•	Against Ramseyfication: role-only identification underperforms models that include independently specified anchors; ablation reveals the deficit.
10) The disciplinary consequence
Sellars’ status illustrates the peril of plastic gods: figures whose slogans are malleable enough to fit any project while settling nothing. The remedy is not another slogan but an institutional flip: build-and-test over talk-and-cite. Engines force convergence; discourse drifts.

Claims about Berkeley’s priority, the generalization beyond color to distance/shape/size/motion, and the regress-blocking role of multimodal integration are documented in the author’s manuscript

, which also critiques metaphor-driven anti-foundationalism and contrasts it with Berkeley’s non-metaphorical mechanism.
