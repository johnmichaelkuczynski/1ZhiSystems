The Psychodynamics of Mass Violence: Sexuality, Aggression, and the Khmer Rouge
Abstract

This article examines the psychodynamic underpinnings of mass violence under the Khmer Rouge, with particular attention to the convergence of aggression and sexuality. Although the regime projected a puritanical ideology that sought to suppress private desire, evidence from prisons and detention centers reveals that sexual violence was common. This analysis argues that sexual violence was not a deviation from Khmer Rouge policy but a predictable outcome of a system that authorized unlimited aggression and provided cadres with access to otherwise unattainable gratifications. By situating sexual violence within the larger logic of terror, the article challenges apologetic narratives that present the atrocities as “mistakes” or later deviations from an initially idealistic project.

1. Introduction

The Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1979) is remembered as one of the most destructive social experiments of the twentieth century. Much of the scholarship has focused on ideology, geopolitics, and the structures of agrarian autarky. Less attention has been given to the psychodynamics of the violence itself: why individuals embraced torture and execution with such apparent zeal, and why sexual violence was so pervasive despite the regime’s puritanical rhetoric. This article argues that Khmer Rouge violence provided its perpetrators with a unique convergence of aggression and sexual gratification. Far from being accidental excesses, these acts were intrinsic to the logic of revolutionary justice as practiced by the regime.

2. Ideology and Sexual Puritanism

Official Khmer Rouge doctrine tightly regulated intimacy. Marriage was arranged by the Party, romantic attachments were condemned, and sexual relations outside sanctioned unions were punishable. The Party promoted an image of ascetic, disciplined cadres who placed the collective above private desire. This outward puritanism, however, masked a structural hypocrisy: behind the rhetoric, detention centers became zones where sexuality and aggression fused.

3. Structural Opportunity and Psychological Payoff

Most Khmer Rouge cadres were drawn from impoverished rural backgrounds. For such men, opportunities for sexual access were limited by traditional kinship structures, poverty, and social constraints. In the revolutionary environment, those constraints were erased. Detention centers such as S-21 not only sanctioned violence but also made women captives available as objects of domination. Under the guise of “revolutionary justice,” cadres could gratify both aggressive and sexual drives with impunity.

This was not incidental. Violence against prisoners was legitimated as service to the revolution, and sexual violence could be reframed as an extension of punishment. The psychodynamic effect was profound: perpetrators experienced themselves as fulfilling both personal desire and political duty.

4. The Collapse of Restraint

In ordinary village life, acts of sexual violence would have carried social risk — retaliation by family members, communal sanction, or legal punishment. Under Khmer Rouge rule, those restraints collapsed. The revolution dismantled kinship structures, eliminated traditional authorities, and delegitimized pre-existing moral codes. What remained was an environment in which gratification through violence was not only permitted but valorized.

5. Implications for Understanding Mass Violence

This analysis complicates narratives that present Khmer Rouge atrocities as “excesses” or unintended by-products of revolutionary idealism. From the first days of the regime — the evacuation of Phnom Penh, the immediate use of torture, and the sanctioning of executions — violence was not accidental but constitutive. For many perpetrators, the regime offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to merge aggression, sexuality, and impunity.

The implication is that genocidal regimes should be analyzed not only in terms of ideology and structure but also in terms of psychodynamic incentives. Violence persists when it gratifies otherwise frustrated drives under conditions of absolute impunity.

6. Conclusion

The Khmer Rouge did not merely fail to live up to its ideals; it constructed a system in which violence itself became the currency of both political loyalty and personal gratification. Recognizing the psychodynamics of aggression and sexuality helps explain both the intensity of the violence and the absence of genuine remorse among perpetrators. For many, the revolution was not a deviation from their expectations but the fulfillment of desires that civil life had always denied.
