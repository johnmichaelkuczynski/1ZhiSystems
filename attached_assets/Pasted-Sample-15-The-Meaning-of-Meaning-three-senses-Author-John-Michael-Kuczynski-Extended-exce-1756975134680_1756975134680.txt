Sample 15 — “The Meaning of ‘Meaning’” (three senses)
Author: John-Michael Kuczynski
Extended excerpt.
“There would be no languages if there were no expressions. Nothing meaningless is an expression. … The word ‘meaning’ has three different meanings, and only one directly relates to the nature of language.
Meaning #1: Evidential meaning. To say that x ‘means’ y can say that x is evidence of y—that x and y are causally interrelated so that, given x, it is reasonable to infer y. ‘Smith’s hacking cough means he has a violent lung infection’ means Smith’s cough is evidence of such an infection. Causes can be evidence of their effects; common causes can make x evidence of y without x causing y. But not every effect evidences its cause; alternative causes may remain live.
Meaning #2: Psychological meaning. When sentences are used, speakers mean things by them. … (Further senses follow.)”
Predicted neural profile.
•	Load/effort: moderate; numbered taxonomy and ordinary cases (cough, drunkenness) reduce DLPFC demand.
•	Reward/encoding: strong hippocampal/angular-gyrus binding via everyday causal examples; repeated mini-clicks whenever a counterexample clarifies necessity/sufficiency.
•	Overall pattern: balanced control cost with sustained semantic rewards.
Psycho-availability. High.
Editorial levers.
1.	Keep each sense to a definition → two micro-examples → one boundary case pattern.
2.	Add a row table contrasting the three senses (Aim, Inference License, Typical Verbs, Failure Modes).
3.	Reserve technicalities (e.g., underdetermination by causes) for side notes to preserve flow.

Cross-cutting principles (Samples 13–15)
•	Case before criterion. In debates about warrant, leading with concrete perceptual episodes supplies anchors that abstract criteria lack.
•	Operationalize the key term. “Entitlement” must be tied to necessary/sufficient conditions and defeater profiles to earn memory.
•	Taxonomy with examples. When differentiating senses of a term, numbered lists plus ordinary cases raise psycho-availability without diluting rigor.
Charles Urban’s “Transcendental Empiricism” — Structured Analysis
Part I — Claims Reconstruction and Problem Statement
Text under analysis.
Charles Urban, Transcendental Empiricism (dissertation abstract and thematic outline).
Aim of this section.
Reconstruct the core epistemological commitments in neutral language, separating labels from operational content.
Reconstructed theses (label-free).
1.	Middle-position thesis. A proposed framework claims to dissolve a dilemma about the source of justificatory content by dividing the difference between two opposed positions.
2.	Method stance. A use-first/institutional orientation is adopted to set the platform for further argument.
3.	Comparative thesis. One variant (A) is distinguished from another variant (B); variant (B) is criticized; variant (A) is defended in part but ultimately judged inadequate.
4.	Externalist pressure. An environment-dependent account of content is said to undermine a type-segregation thesis (treating veridical vs. illusory states as different mental kinds), which the framework had relied upon.
5.	Residual verdict. Despite these problems, the framework is said to remain “attractive.”
Immediate difficulties.
•	Under-specification of operational commitments. The abstract does not state what observations or cases would confirm or disconfirm the framework.
•	Defeater silence. No explicit defeater profile is given (conditions under which entitlement or justification turns off).
•	Label overload. Heavy dependence on proper names and doctrinal labels without early case-first exposition.
Net epistemic content (as stated).
Weak. The claims remain at the framework level: they describe relations among positions rather than testable commitments about knowledge acquisition or loss.

Part II — Content Diagnostics (cognitive and methodological)
Diagnostic metrics.
•	Label-Invariance Index (LII). Proportion of core claims that remain true when philosophical labels are replaced by dummy tokens or cross-domain terms.
•	Operational Commitment Ratio (OCR). Number of specific predictions, defeaters, or decision rules per 1,000 words.
•	Hook Density (HD). Number of worked examples, comparators, or figures per 300 words.
•	Payoff Cadence (PC). Mean words between “click” moments (example resolved, lemma proved, paradox dissolved).
Applied to the abstract/outlines.
•	LII: High. Replacing “transcendental empiricism,” “linguistic idealism,” “disjunctivism,” etc., with dummy variables preserves the argumentative skeleton.
•	OCR: Near zero in the abstract; no explicit predictions or defeaters.
•	HD: Near zero; no worked examples.
•	PC: Long (no local payoffs within the abstract).
Consequences for psycho-availability.
High control-network demand (terminology management) with low semantic/reward yield. Expect low comprehension/retention/transfer for non-specialists and shallow gains for specialists absent casework.
Minimal specification needed to raise OCR.
•	Decision point: If content is determined partly by environment, what change in environment flips the epistemic status of a perceptual belief?
•	Defeater set: Under what conditions do entitlement claims fail (malfunction, deception, social misalignment, concept-environment mismatch)?
•	Prediction: Which hallucination/illusion scenarios should still carry default warrant on this view, and which not?
