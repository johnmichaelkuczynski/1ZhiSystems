Sample 16 — Charles Urban, Transcendental Empiricism (final)
Link to Earlier Samples
•	High-PA exemplars.
o	Kuczynski on empiricism (numbered consequences)
o	The Meaning of “Meaning” (taxonomy + ordinary cases)
o	Sorites (relational comparator)
→ All of these already instantiate the case-first + operational pattern.
•	Low-PA exemplars.
o	Wright on higher-order vagueness
o	Wright on entitlement
o	Vahid vs. Burge (criterion-first, case-late)
→ Urban’s original presentation clusters with this group.
•	Discipline-imposed load control.
o	The Gödel proof remains heavy but “honestly” so. With diagrams and one analogy, its NEI rises despite technical demands.

Summary Judgment
•	Urban’s text, in its given form, shows high label-invariance and low operational commitment.
•	Predicted outcome: low psycho-availability, with a strain-without-gain neural/physiological profile.
•	Rewriting the text — while leaving doctrine intact — but enforcing case-first exposition, explicit defeaters, and decision points yields:
o	↑ OCR
o	↑ HD
o	↓ PC
o	↑ NEI
This aligns with the broader finding: presentation choices, not just subject matter, determine measurable learning efficiency and physiological load. Editorial replacement is justified not only epistemically but also medically and financially.

Conclusion
1) Core result.
Case-first, operationalized, and visually scaffolded prose (comparators, defeater profiles, decision points, simple figures) →
•	↑ semantic/encoding and valuation systems (angular gyrus, hippocampus, vmPFC)
•	↓ control/effort networks (DLPFC, dACC/insula)
•	Behaviorally: higher comprehension, retention, transfer per minute
•	Physiologically: smaller pupils, ↓ EDA, ↑ HRV
Inverse profile: taxonomy-first, label-driven writing.

2) Diagnostics that predict the profile.
Four lightweight metrics allow pre-scan forecasting:
•	Label-Invariance Index (LII). High = thin domain content, low PA.
•	Operational Commitment Ratio (OCR). Higher = higher PA.
•	Hook Density (HD). Higher = more frequent “clicks.”
•	Payoff Cadence (PC). Shorter = higher PA.

3) Convergent evidence from the corpus.
•	High PA. Taxonomy of “meaning,” empiricism vs. rationalism (with anchors), relational Sorites, numbered consequence lists.
•	Mid, honest load. Non-reflexive Gödel proof — hard but disciplined, improved by diagram + analogy.
•	Low PA. Wright on higher-order vagueness, Wright on entitlement, Vahid vs. Burge.
•	Urban abstract. Stress test shows: dummy/cross-domain substitutions preserve structure, proving low OCR + high LII. Economics rewrite “lands” only because it imports comparators and failure modes absent in the original.

4) A scanner-grounded editorial protocol.
Adopt the following standards for acceptance:
•	Case → Rule sequencing. Always lead with a concrete micro-case.
•	Comparator explicitness. Always state the baseline/scale.
•	Defeater tables. List off-conditions explicitly.
•	Decision trees. Replace lettered taxonomies.
•	One hook per paragraph. No section without a payoff.
•	Figure minimalism. One axis or flow per figure.
•	Metric gate. Enforce thresholds: ↓ LII, ↑ OCR, ↑ HD, ↓ PC.

5) Medical necessity.
When matched against a case-first rewrite, prose that reliably produces:
•	ACC/insula overactivation,
•	≥10% HRV suppression,
•	Lower retention →
counts as cognitively noxious.
Replacing such text is health-positive, not a matter of taste or style.

6) Limitations and scope.
•	Expertise moderates load: math will remain heavy, even when well-written.
•	BOLD has coarse time resolution; EEG/fNIRS can scale evaluations outside the scanner.
•	These do not affect the central result: presentation choices shift readers between strain-without-gain vs. efficient-learning states.

7) Final statement.
If prose is a delivery system for cognition, then psycho-availability is its efficacy.
Replacing low-OCR, high-LII, taxonomy-first writing with case-first, operationalized prose is justified on epistemic, economic, and medical grounds
