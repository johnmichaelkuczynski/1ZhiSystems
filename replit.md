## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API**: RESTful API structure (currently minimal)
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage with planned database integration

### Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon Database serverless)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Current State**: Database fully integrated with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL backend

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Home Page**: Main landing page displaying all books and applications in organized sections
- **Journal System**: Complete blog system with listing, individual issues, and admin interface
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of reusable components from shadcn/ui
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

### Backend Components
- **Express Server**: Basic server setup with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation
- **Vite Integration**: Development server integration for hot reloading

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user entity with id, username, and password fields
- **Journal Issues Table**: Complete blog system for "Zhi Systems Journal" with volume/issue numbering
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing between client and server

## Data Flow

1. **Static Content**: All book and application data is hardcoded in the frontend component
2. **Client Routing**: Single-page application with minimal routing (home page and 404)
3. **API Calls**: TanStack Query setup for future API integration
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error boundary and toast notifications

## External Dependencies

### UI and Styling
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives

- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Class Variance Authority**: Utility for creating component variants

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Custom plugins for development environment
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

### Database and ORM
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL client
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit
- **Drizzle Zod**: Schema validation integration

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React application to `dist/`
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Static Assets**: Served directly by Express in production

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: `NODE_ENV=development` with Vite dev server
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production` serving static files
- **Database**: Configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build`: Production build for both client and server
- `npm run start`: Production server
- `npm run db:push`: Push database schema changes

### Render Deployment Ready (August 19, 2025)
- **Status**: Deployment issue resolved - missing Vite and ESBuild dependencies fixed
- **Configuration**: `render.yaml` with all required environment variables and PostgreSQL setup
- **Build Fixed**: Added missing Vite and ESBuild dependencies that were causing deployment failures
- **Build Verified**: Production build successful (508KB frontend, 50.6KB server)
- **Files Created**: Complete deployment configuration, documentation, and setup guide
- **Database**: PostgreSQL integration ready with Drizzle ORM
- **Health Check**: Configured for `/api/journal` endpoint
- **Environment**: Added graceful API key handling with proper error messages
- **Documentation**: Created `DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions
